#   Use the scripts in this directory to generate portions of condor.submit files
#
#   Each script should be run from the command line. Look inside each to find the
#   appropriate files and their locations to use as parameters
#
#   Paste the output of the format scripts into the corresponding submit script.
#
#   The scripts' content may need to be modified if different parameters, etc.
#       are used.  Be sure to closely run a test case and confirm that the
#       output generated by the script matches your expectations
#
#   Also, if parallel multiple inputs are used, be sure that output of the script maintains
#   the expected parallelism over the course of the entire output. The files should be
#   sorted numerically by sample number
#
