#   Use the scripts in this directory to generate portions of condor.submit files
#
#   Most of the scripts require you to use readLines() to get a list of files 
#       (which you'll then pass to the function defined in the script)
#
#   The scripts' content may need to be modified if different parameters, etc.
#       are used.  Be sure to closely run a test case and confirm that the
#       output generated by the script matches your expectations
#
#   Also, if parallel multiple inputs are used, be sure that output of the script maintains
#       the expected parallelism over the course of the entire output
#
