  <help>
    The MiXCR Assemble tool takes the alignment information and sequencing reads from MiXCR Align and uses them to extract specific gene regions. Our tool currently extracts the CDR3 locus and does not support other loci. Once these gene regions are identified, sets of "clones" (unique CDR3 sequence) are built. Reads are dropped based on a variety of factors such as lack of sequence and low quality base calls. A mapping program is utilized to rescue reads of moderate sequence quality based on similarity to those of high quality. Finally a clustering program clusters similar reads together to produce final counts of unique clones (unique CDR3 sequences).
