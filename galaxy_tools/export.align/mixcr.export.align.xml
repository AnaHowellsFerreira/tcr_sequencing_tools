  <help>
    This tool exports the alignments produced by the MiXCR Align command so that they may be manually inspected. Information such as best V, D, and J alignments are contained in these files. In addition, the read ID that gave rise to each alignment is also saved. At this time, the "indexing" option in MiXCR Assemble is not supported, so this tool cannot export the clone ID that each read gives rise to.
